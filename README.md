# Table-Top Character Progression Tool

## Description

This application allows the user to keep track of character statistics, health, level, backstory, and inventory when playing a table-top role-playing game.  

When the application first opens, characters are directed to a welcome page with navigational links across the top.  These links allow the user to access a basic character, backstory, and inventory.

The character sheet that includes their basic character information (name, race, class, and level) as well as their current statistics and health.  These statistics can be changed by using the "+" and "-" buttons directly next to them.  This page also includes a tool that allows a user to virtually "roll dice" in the event that they do not have physical dice, or prefer to roll digitally.  Simply click the button labeled with the correct die and the roll will show up under the "current roll" title.

When navigating to the backstory page, a textarea is displayed that allows the user to edit their character's backstory, should they choose to do so.

The inventory page includes a list of current items possessed by the user's character, as well as the item stat (damage or amor class) and weight of each item.  This page has a form at the top that allows the user to add items to their inventory, should they need to.  To do so, add the name, stat (it is helpful to include "Damage:" for weapons or "AC:" for armore before the actual stat) and weight of the item in the corresponding form fields, and click the "submit" button.

## Roadmap

Currently, no changes to the character information or stats will persist in the event of a page refresh.  Changes to inventory, however, will be permanent and will persist in the event of a page refresh.  Development is in the process of changing this so that all changes will be permanent and persist even when the page is refreshed.
